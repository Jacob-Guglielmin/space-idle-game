PLANETS: 
minerals which spawn in MINING AREA and DRILL 
some sort of liquid/fuel/oil from PUMP (gathers in pump tank automatically then taken, kind of like clash of clans)

RESOURCES:
- iron is used in most things
- copper is used for pump upgrades
- aluminum is used for drill upgrades
- lead is used for mining tool upgrades
- titanium is used for ship upgrades
- fuel accumulates slowly over time in pump, once threshold is reached new planets can be reached

UPGRADES:
- pump upgrades (would upgrade both capacity and speed, eventually automatic gathering maybe at an interval)
- mining tool upgrades (more return per click in manual mining area, maybe some powerups like clearing whole mine or bigger radius)
- drill upgrades (just simply more stuff)
- ship upgrades are very uncommon and increase planet selection options and better resources in planets available
